      <h1>Bug: touch events on iframes and overlapping elements</h1>
      <p class="agents">
        Observed in MobileSafari for all iOS versions, different in 4.1.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Description of bug:</strong>
        Touch events on iframes are broken in all versions of iOS: if
        an element sits over an iframe, touch events will fire on the iframe
        underneath - which is incorrect, and differs from WebKit mouse event
        behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        In iOS 4.1, the behaviour is much worse: <em>touchend</em> events are
        not fired at the correct time, and unpaired <em>touchstart</em> events
        fire on lower DOM elements and higher z-index elements at the end
        of a touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several tests in this suite:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="1.html">A single iframe</a></li>
        <li><a href="2.html">An iframe with an overlapping div</a></li>
        <li><a href="3.html">Two overlapping iframes, with a div above</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        NB: in all the tests, you can tap on the coloured event output
        to start a new "event section".
      </p>

      <p>
        A fix for this was included with Version 2.0 of Monocle. As the bug
        has not been sighted since iOS 4.1, the fix has been removed from
        the codebase.
